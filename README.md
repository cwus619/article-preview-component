## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge as my first step into using some simple CSS Grid; I found that using CSS Grid made placement of most elements on the page a lot easier than when using flexbox, especially for this particular challenge. I have in the meantime also made further amendments to the grid, switching from a fixed pixel widths/heights to percentages.
This was also the first time I used the <svg> tag. I had initially added all SVG files in as images, and this is still the case for the social medica icons; however, given that the colouring of the share arrow could not be amended like this, the only way for me to complete the challenge in accordance with the prescribed specifications, I had add in this image within the <svg> tag.

### Continued development

Having used <svg>, I'll continue to add in SVG images within the <svg> tag where appropriate; similarly, I intend to continue to practice using CSS Grid in conjunction with flexbox when completing other challenges.
In addition, I still hope to make greater use of different JS libraries, and may look into using JQuery for future challenges - I have used this in the past, but not extensively.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/)
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I have been making use of css-tricks for several projects recently to review and better understand how flexbox works - I find the guide very intuitive with its visual aids.
- [Speech Bubble Resource](http://projects.verou.me/bubbly/) - I actually obtained the code to create the speech bubble in which the social media icons appear from here.
